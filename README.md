# storybook-addon-deps-empty-deps-demo

I simplify my components to reproduce the problem : I have two components `Button` and `ButtonGroup`.

I expect `Button` to be a dependency of `ButtonGroup` but I always see "no dependencies found for this component".

To run the demo :

`$ yarn`

`$ yarn storybook`
